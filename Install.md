# Install using PEASS_ng
- Clone https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng repository
- Create a new directory (/opt/totalparser or such)
- Copy "parsers" directory from PEASS_ng into /opt/totalparser/
- Copy 'parsePEASS.sh' into /opt/totalparser/parsePEASS.sh
- This way you have a clean surface with folder parsers and script outside
- Put raw output file inside /opt/totalparser for parsing and creating HTML or PDF files. 
- Should look like this:

# Install without PEASS_ng
- PEASS_ng python parsers are included and you can download them from here
- I however suggest you go to PEASS_ng repo and use theirs.
-
- Clone the repo or download files
- Create a new directory (/opt/totalparser or such)
- Copy "parsers" folder and "parsePEASS.sh" into /opt/totalparser/
- This way you have a clean surface with folder parsers and script outside
- Put raw output file inside /opt/totalparser for parsing and creating HTML or PDF files. 

- Should look same as picture above.
